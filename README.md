# A2A Multi-Agent Hedge Fund System

This project implements an intelligent multi-agent hedge fund simulation using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and Google’s A2A Protocol. It coordinates market analysis, sentiment aggregation, macroeconomic interpretation, forecasting, and risk evaluation through an agentic workflow architecture.

## Project Overview

This system is designed as a modular, real-time investment strategy engine. It leverages specialized AI agents — each focused on one domain (e.g., sentiment, macroeconomics, forecasting) — and orchestrates them via LangGraph to simulate institutional-level financial decision-making.
